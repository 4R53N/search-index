This is a simple demo for making `search-index` do work in a web worker.

To run this demo- navigate to this directory and execute the following command:

`browserify main.js > bundle.js`

You can then see the demo by opening `index.html`.

Note that in this case, the documents are indexed in the browser after the page is openened. Keep an eye on the console to see when indexing completes.
