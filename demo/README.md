# Search-index in the browser
Plain JavaScript exammple. Just some simple stuff to listen to button clicks, getting content from form and doing populating HTML when doing a search.

## What's needed:
* Data in
* Data out
* Empty index?

## Known bug and workaround
First indexed document is not searchable. Workaround: Generating ID's for each document added.
